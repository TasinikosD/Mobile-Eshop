# Mobile-Eshop
This repository contains a project developed by me and my fellow students as part of a university course. It is an Eshop app for a marketplace.  The app is built using Kotlin and uses Firebase for managing product and user data. We also used Firebase Authentication to allow users to register, login, reset passwords, and enjoy a complete experience.
